Design Patterns
-----------------

1. Creational Patterns
2. Structural Patterns
3. Behavioral Patterns

Creational Patterns
-------------------

These patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. 
The basic form of object creation could result in design problems or added complexity to the design. 
Creational design patterns solve this problem by somehow controlling this object creation.

1. Singleton
2. Factory Method
3. Abstract Factory
4. Builder
5. Prototype

Structural Patterns
-------------------

These patterns deal with object composition. They describe how classes and objects can be composed to form larger structures.

1. Adapter
2. Bridge
3. Composite
4. Decorator
5. Facade
6. Flyweight
7. Proxy


Behavioral Patterns
-------------------

These patterns are concerned with communication between objects.

1. Chain of Responsibility
2. Command
3. Interpreter
4. Iterator
5. Mediator
6. Memento
7. Observer
8. State
9. Strategy
10. Template Method
