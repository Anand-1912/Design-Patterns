### **Why Modularity, Reusability, and Scalability Are Hard to Achieve in Procedural Programming (C)?**  

Procedural languages like **C** rely on **functions and global data structures** rather than **objects and classes**. This makes it **difficult to manage large, complex applications** compared to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) languages like C# or Java.

Let’s analyze **why procedural programming struggles with modularity, reusability, and scalability**, using real-world examples.

---

## **1. Lack of Modularity in Procedural Programming**
### **Problem:**  
In C, data is often stored in **global variables**, and functions operate on these directly. This leads to **poor encapsulation**, making debugging and maintaining large programs difficult.

### **Example: Bank Account System in C (No Encapsulation)**
```c
#include <stdio.h>

double balance = 0;  // Global variable (no encapsulation)

void deposit(double amount) {
    balance += amount;
    printf("Deposited: $%.2f, New Balance: $%.2f\n", amount, balance);
}

void withdraw(double amount) {
    if (amount > balance) {
        printf("Insufficient balance!\n");
    } else {
        balance -= amount;
        printf("Withdrawn: $%.2f, Remaining Balance: $%.2f\n", amount, balance);
    }
}

int main() {
    deposit(500);
    withdraw(200);
    return 0;
}
```
### **Why is this bad?**
❌ **No Encapsulation** – The `balance` variable is **global**, meaning any function can modify it. This could lead to **accidental modifications**.  
❌ **No Data Protection** – There's no way to **restrict access** to `balance` like we do in OOP with `private` variables.  
❌ **Difficult Maintenance** – If we need to track multiple accounts, we **must rewrite the entire code**, leading to **duplication**.  

### ✅ **OOP Solution (C#)**
In **OOP**, we use **classes** to encapsulate data and control access.  
```csharp
class BankAccount {
    private double balance; // Encapsulated variable

    public void Deposit(double amount) { balance += amount; }
    public void Withdraw(double amount) {
        if (amount <= balance) balance -= amount;
    }
}
```
👉 **Encapsulation protects `balance`, ensuring only valid operations modify it.**

---

## **2. Lack of Reusability in Procedural Programming**
### **Problem:**  
In procedural languages like **C**, if multiple types of objects share common behaviors, we must **duplicate code** because **C lacks inheritance**.

### **Example: E-Commerce Products in C (No Inheritance)**
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

struct Electronics {
    char name[20];
    double price;
    char brand[20];
};

void displayElectronics(struct Electronics e) {
    printf("Electronics: %s, Brand: %s, Price: $%.2f\n", e.name, e.brand, e.price);
}

struct Clothing {
    char name[20];
    double price;
    char size[5];
};

void displayClothing(struct Clothing c) {
    printf("Clothing: %s, Size: %s, Price: $%.2f\n", c.name, c.size, c.price);
}

int main() {
    struct Electronics laptop = {"Laptop", 1200, "Dell"};
    struct Clothing tshirt = {"T-Shirt", 25, "M"};

    displayElectronics(laptop);
    displayClothing(tshirt);

    return 0;
}
```
### **Why is this bad?**
❌ **Code Duplication** – Both `Electronics` and `Clothing` **repeat the same attributes** (`name`, `price`).  
❌ **Hard to Extend** – If we add a new product type (e.g., `Book`), we must **write another struct and function**.  
❌ **No Reusability** – There's **no mechanism** to reuse common properties across multiple product types.

### ✅ **OOP Solution (C#)**
OOP solves this using **inheritance**, so all products share the same base class.
```csharp
class Product {
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public double Price { get; set; }
}

class Electronics : Product {
    public string Brand { get; set; }
}

class Clothing : Product {
    public string Size { get; set; }
}
```
👉 **New product types can be added without modifying existing code.**

---

## **3. Lack of Scalability in Procedural Programming**
### **Problem:**  
When adding new features, procedural programming requires **modifying existing functions**, which increases the risk of **breaking** the system.

### **Example: Ride-Sharing System in C (No Polymorphism)**
Let's say we need to calculate ride fares for different ride types (Economy, Premium, and Electric).  
In **C**, we have to **explicitly check ride types** using `if-else`, making it **difficult to add new ride types**.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

double calculateFare(char rideType[], double distance) {
    if (strcmp(rideType, "Economy") == 0)
        return distance * 5;
    else if (strcmp(rideType, "Premium") == 0)
        return distance * 10;
    else if (strcmp(rideType, "Electric") == 0)
        return distance * 8;
    else
        return 0;
}

int main() {
    printf("Fare: $%.2f\n", calculateFare("Premium", 10));
    return 0;
}
```
### **Why is this bad?**
❌ **Hard to Scale** – If we want to add a new ride type (`Luxury`), we must **modify `calculateFare()`**, affecting existing functionality.  
❌ **No Flexibility** – We cannot dynamically change ride behavior.  
❌ **Risk of Bugs** – The more ride types we add, the more conditions we have to check, increasing complexity.

### ✅ **OOP Solution (C#)**
Using **polymorphism**, new ride types can be added **without modifying existing code**.
```csharp
abstract class Ride {
    public abstract double CalculateFare(double distance);
}

class EconomyRide : Ride {
    public override double CalculateFare(double distance) { return distance * 5; }
}

class PremiumRide : Ride {
    public override double CalculateFare(double distance) { return distance * 10; }
}
```
👉 **New ride types can be added without modifying existing logic.**

## **Final Comparison: OOP vs. Procedural Programming**
| Feature | Procedural (C) | Object-Oriented (C#) |
|---------|----------------|----------------|
| **Modularity** | Uses global variables and functions, leading to **poor organization**. | Uses **classes** to encapsulate data, improving organization. |
| **Reusability** | Code is often **duplicated** because there is no inheritance. | **Inheritance** allows reuse of common features. |
| **Scalability** | Adding new features requires **modifying existing code**, increasing risks. | **Polymorphism** allows extending functionality **without modifying existing code**. |

---

## **Conclusion**
❌ **Procedural Programming (C)** is **not ideal for large-scale applications** because:
- It lacks **encapsulation**, making data vulnerable.
- It lacks **inheritance**, forcing code duplication.
- It lacks **polymorphism**, making future expansion difficult.

✅ **Object-Oriented Programming (C#)** provides:
- **Modularity** (better organization using classes).
- **Reusability** (avoiding code duplication through inheritance).
- **Scalability** (easier feature expansion using abstraction and polymorphism).

🚀 **For modern applications like banking systems, e-commerce platforms, and ride-sharing apps, OOP is the preferred approach!**
